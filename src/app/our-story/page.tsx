                  <p className="mb-6">
                  This idea of Relevaince started over a steak dinner one night between two friends - one who had been in the legal industry for 40 years (gasp) and one who had been in big data and Al for about the same amount of time.  And yes, we know what you're probably thinking - two old guys had an idea about solving an age-old problem of inefficiency in the legal arena with new technology, which is exactly what they did!
